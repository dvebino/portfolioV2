## Personal Portfolio

This website was built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is designed to be responsive and easy to navigate, making it accessible on any device.

On the homepage, you will find an overview of my experience and skills, as well as my most recent projects. You can also find my resume and contact information in the footer of the website.

The Projects page features a selection of my most recent and notable projects, each with a brief description and a link to view the project live or on GitHub.

Please feel free to explore the website and contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project.

Thank you for visiting!
